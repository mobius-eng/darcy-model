#+TITLE: Darcy model TODO list and documentation

* Features to add and implement
** TODO Sort out the dependencies[0/2]
*** TODO Complete =CL-NUMERICS-LINEAR=
    Don't need to do anything really, for =CL-NUMERICS= to work.
*** TODO Changes in =CL-NUMERICS= [5/7]
**** DONE Merge UTILS.LISP and CL-NUMERICS-SCALAR
     CLOSED: [2017-06-28 Wed 13:37]
**** DONE UTILS.LISP: RMS-NORM and EWT are the only ones depending on linear
     CLOSED: [2017-06-28 Wed 13:37]
     They are not used anywhere anyway, maybe just remove them.
**** DONE QUAD.LISP: requires inifities -- supply in CL-NUMERICS-SCALAR
     CLOSED: [2017-06-28 Wed 13:37]
**** DONE QUAD.LISP: Add documentation
     CLOSED: [2017-06-28 Wed 13:48]
**** TODO QUAD.LISP: Improve abstraction layer
     Translate error codes to conditions.
**** DONE ODE.LISP: Add documentation
     CLOSED: [2017-06-28 Wed 13:56]
**** TODO ODE.LISP: Simplify LSODA-STEP
     Function decoration and =RTOL= and =ATOL= manipulations must be
     performed once only in evolve (drive) function.
** TODO User functions to run model [2/4]
*** DONE Unsaturated model properties [3/3]
**** DONE Saturation-capillary pressure plot
     CLOSED: [2017-06-29 Thu 00:23]
     - [X] Instantiate models
     - [X] Get the results in Maxima's form
**** DONE Saturation-conductivity plot
     CLOSED: [2017-06-29 Thu 00:24]
**** DONE Plots wiht varying parameters
     CLOSED: [2017-06-29 Thu 21:43]
*** TODO Create model[1/4]
**** DONE Uniform model with const flow rate
     CLOSED: [2017-06-30 Fri 13:18]
**** TODO Uniform model with intermittent flow rate
**** TODO Perturbed packing model with const flow rate
**** TODO Perturbed packing with perturbed flow rate
*** DONE Create simulation
    CLOSED: [2017-06-30 Fri 16:51]
*** TODO Disect the results in Maxima & build plots[3/4]
**** DONE Convert result arrays to lists.
     CLOSED: [2017-06-30 Fri 16:51]
**** TODO Plot the results[2/3]
     - [X] Saturation
     - [X] Discharge
     - [ ] Water content/volume
**** DONE See how to pass more parameters to gnuplot.
     CLOSED: [2017-06-30 Fri 16:51]
**** DONE maxima and org-mode: display results and plots
     CLOSED: [2017-06-30 Fri 16:52]
     This one doesn't work: ob-maxima does not support sessions.
